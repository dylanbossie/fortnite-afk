# fortnite-afk

Tool to automate afk'ing in Fortnite solo Creative lobbies through the use of AutoIt3. Also includes a tool to get a pixel area checksum for updating regions if the checksums change for any reason.

Tracks game states by checking unique pixel regions of different interfaces to reactively enter and exit solo Creative lobbies. The defined regions are set to values that work for my monitor/resolution, but likely need updating for any other use case.
